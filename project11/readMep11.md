* SSH in the Jenkins-ansible server and run the commands below

* **WEBHOOK:** Please note that a webhook is set in a repo to allow external services to be notified when certain events happen. When the specific event happens, github will send a post event to each url specified.
* Create a webhook in Jenkins and put in the url of git hub with a *github-webhook* suffix. (example: http://34.235.88.172:8080/github-webhook/)
